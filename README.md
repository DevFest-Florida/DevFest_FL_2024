### Recreating Android Project

If you need to recreate the Android project for any reason, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
flutter create --project-name devfestfl .
```

This command is necessary because the root folder is named `DevFest_FL_2024` while the project name in `pubspec.yaml` is `devfestfl`.
