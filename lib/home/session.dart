Sometimes it seems like we're losing the battle.\n\nThere is hope, though! The WebAuthn protocol provides a stronger, easier way for users to authenticate themselves. It uses secure hardware and asymmetric cryptography to provide a strong addition to passwords, or a complete replacement. Best of all, it's easy to implement, and already supported by services you're using today.\n\nCome to this talk to learn how WebAuthn works, how you can use it to protect your accounts, and how to add support to your software. WebAuthn is a powerful tool to help keep the Internet safe, but it's up to us to use it.",

        "Orlando has a major hurdle to overcome on its way to becoming a tech hub. We've got a ton of great Junior developers, and a ton of job openings for Senior Developers. We've all come across this mismatch of availability and opportunity either as applicants ourselves, or as our teams look to fill gaps and scale. So where does this mismatch come from? Orlando has a startup mentality, focused on bringing products to customers as fast as possible and with as little as possible. This means companies are trying to deliver more with less, looking for top talent that can deliver on tight deadlines. We also don't have major tech companies you might find in Silicon Valley in our area with the resources and scale to take junior developers and spend the time and money training them into more accomplished developers.\n\nHowever, all is not lost. It's possible to leverage Orlando's large pool of Junior talent without sacrificing the bottom line. This talk is about how startups and companies can employ some junior talent and also the benefits that juniors bring to a company: better retention, communication, more maintainable codebases, etc. I'd also like to explain how junior developers provide huge benefits for an established team, and how they can provide opportunities for senior team members to improve their mentorship and leadership skills.
